    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>You pumkin spice-sippin', Seattle cunts are in luck! Here at Pat's we've developed
      a way to bake fish right into cookies! Started just last year, right here in Seattle, we've already expanded to 5 locations with more on the way. Thanks to the support of this incredible depressing city we've served up over 700,000 cookies. We look forward to our further expansion and thank you all for your fucked palletes and support!

        "These cookies are fantastic! My grandkids LOVE them! I know this because I got them all Pat's Salmon Cookies for Hanukkah and the majority found themselves speechless and unable to do anything but nod their heads [in approval] while eating them. I haven't seen them that excited since thier passover readings!"
